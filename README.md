A zoo of taxonomies for labelling domain names (as in DNS) (and IP addresses)


This repository collects and documents known taxonomies in the field of IT-Security ("Cyber") as well as internet wide research.
A taxonomy is a way of (potentially) labelling objects and giving them meaning.
Specifically, objects in this context are DNS domain names and/or IP addresses.

The list of taxonomies contains: 

  * the taxonomy name
  * a link to where it is defined (source)
  * an estimate for suitability for our use case of DNS names/IP addresses.

Naturally, this list will never be complete nor exhaustive. Therefore, we encourage receiving pull requests.

# Examples

  * The DHS (as in Dept. of Homeland Security) published a [taxonomy](https://github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies/blob/master/dhs-ciip-sectors/machinetag.json) for labeling critical infrastructure industry sectors
  * The DNS Low Content domains: lists types of low content (e.g. parking domains, apache default web page, empty web page, etc.) domains
